since adam is claiming that I made this code,
This code was updated with minor feature changes like avatar history (they wanted it to store in the local fs when i told them it was a bad idea)

the original pretend source that i was commissioned to add features to.
the up to date leak i did like a month ago

as you can see other then being reformatted they aren't different.
I made 3 features in this source code, Avatarhistory, and Quotes and Captions (this was how lim wanted it i told him i thought it was shit and that i wanted to do it with rust)
